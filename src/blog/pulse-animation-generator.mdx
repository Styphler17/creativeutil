## Introduction

In modern web design, subtle animations can make a huge difference in user experience. A well-placed animation can guide the user's attention and create a more engaging and interactive feel.

But creating these animations with CSS can be tricky. That's why we built the **CSS Pulse Animation Generator**, a free tool that lets you create beautiful pulse animations with just a few clicks.
