## Introduction

Web accessibility is not just a buzzword, it's a crucial aspect of modern web design. An accessible website is one that can be used by everyone, regardless of their abilities. And one of the most important aspects of web accessibility is **color contrast**.

If the contrast between your text and background colors is too low, it can be difficult or impossible for people with visual impairments to read your content.

That's why we created the **Free Contrast Checker**, a simple tool that helps you test the contrast ratio of your colors to ensure they meet WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines).
