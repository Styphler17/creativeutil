## Introduction

APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) are the backbone of modern web development. They allow different applications to communicate with each other and share data. But working with APIs can be tricky. You have to get the request just right, and it can be hard to debug when things go wrong.

That's why we created the **API Request & Response Playground**, a free tool that helps you build, send, and test HTTP requests with an instant response preview.
